                <p class="px-12 text-center">Farm to Fork is a produce box website focused on bringing goods from local farmers to the home. Many people want to shop locally, supporting small businesses and helping the environment. Although, many people lack the means to go to a farmers market so our aim was to bring this experience to their door!</p>
