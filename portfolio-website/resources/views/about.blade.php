    <p>Hi! I'm Naomi, a computer science student based in Bristol and Birmingham! I go to Aston University, and am currently in my final year of studies. I'm mostly passionate about game development, and many of my projects are related to this. Although, I have also taken an interest in other areas of computer science such as AI and website development. </p>
